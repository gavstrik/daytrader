First version of the daytrader game, where students learn about informational
cascades and futures trading.

In this experiment a firm is represented by a bag, containing a
variable number of 'good' and 'bad' faces. Players have to pull
out one face and guess the overall state of the firm, e.g. whether it is
in a mainly 'good' or mainly 'bad' condition. Informational cascades will
form, but since the bag (in a secondary treatment) can change
its state with a fixed probability, a mix of strategies need to be employed.
